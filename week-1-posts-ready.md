## Post 1.1
**Platform:** Twitter  
**Account:** @HairDAO_  
**Day/Date:** Day 1 (Monday)  

**Copy:**
```
POV: You discover your hairline on a Zoom call

Your confidence: 📉📉📉
Your camera: suddenly "broken"
Your hat collection: 📈📈📈

We're fixing this. One follicle at a time.
```

## Post 1.2
**Platform:** Twitter  
**Account:** @andrew_bakst  
**Day/Date:** Day 1 (Monday)  

**Copy:**
```
The hair loss industry is broken.

Here's why I'm fixing it 🧵
```

**Thread continues:**
```
1/ 80 million Americans experience hair loss.

The "solutions"?
- $10K transplants
- Pills that kill your libido
- Scam supplements with stock photos

It's 2026. We can do better.
```

```
2/ The pharma playbook:

Step 1: Patent a molecule
Step 2: Charge $300/month
Step 3: Fight generics for 20 years
Step 4: Spend more on marketing than R&D

Meanwhile, actual innovation dies in academic papers nobody reads.
```

```
3/ Hair loss research is STUCK.

The last major FDA-approved treatment? 1997.

That's not because we ran out of ideas. It's because the incentives are broken.

Why fund a cure when you can sell a treatment forever?
```

```
4/ Enter DeSci.

Decentralized science flips the model:
→ Community-funded research
→ Open-source findings
→ Patients become stakeholders
→ Aligned incentives

We're not waiting for Big Pharma to save us.
```

```
5/ @HairDAO_ isn't just a company.

It's a bet that patients deserve:
- Transparency on what works
- Access without gatekeepers  
- A seat at the research table

We're building the future of hair science. In public.
```

```
6/ This is personal.

I watched my dad lose his hair and his confidence. Watched friends try everything and get scammed.

Hair loss isn't vanity. It's identity. And it deserves real solutions.

That's why I do this.
```

```
7/ If you're tired of the bullshit:

- Follow @HairDAO_ for updates
- Check our research at [link]
- Join the community

We're just getting started.

And no, we won't ask you to buy a $200 shampoo that doesn't work.
```

## Post 1.3
**Platform:** Twitter  
**Account:** @VerbinnenAndrew  
**Day/Date:** Day 1 (Monday)  

**Copy:**
```
Most people don't understand DHT.

Let me explain in 60 seconds:

DHT (dihydrotestosterone) is testosterone's angrier cousin.

It binds to hair follicles and slowly strangles them. Not because it's "bad" - your body just doesn't know the difference between puberty and pattern baldness.

Here's what actually happens 👇
```

```
Your hair has a growth cycle:
→ Anagen (growing): 2-7 years
→ Catagen (transition): 2 weeks
→ Telogen (resting): 3 months

DHT shortens anagen phase. 

Each cycle, your hair grows back thinner. Shorter. Until it doesn't grow back at all.

This is called follicular miniaturization.
```

```
The kicker?

Not everyone's follicles are sensitive to DHT.

It's genetic. Your beard follicles LOVE DHT. Your scalp follicles might hate it.

Same hormone. Different receptors. Unfair lottery.
```

```
What works:

• Blocking DHT production (finasteride)
• Blocking DHT at the follicle (topicals)
• Stimulating growth regardless (minoxidil)
• Regenerating follicles (where we're innovating)

The future isn't just blocking damage. It's reversing it.

That's what @HairDAO_ is building toward.
```

## Post 2.1
**Platform:** Twitter  
**Account:** @HairDAO_  
**Day/Date:** Day 2 (Tuesday)  

**Copy:**
```
We built an AI that writes patent applications for hair loss treatments.

Her name is Lexy.

She's read every hair science patent ever filed. Every clinical trial. Every rejected FDA application.

This is what AI should actually be used for.

Not chatbots. Cures.
```

**Media suggestion:** Screen recording/GIF of Lexy interface in action, showing patent analysis or generation

## Post 2.2
**Platform:** Twitter  
**Account:** @andrew_bakst  
**Day/Date:** Day 2 (Tuesday)  

**Copy:**
```
Hot take: The FDA approval process kills more people than it saves.

A drug that could help millions sits in review for 12 years while people suffer.

"Safety" has become a shield for bureaucratic paralysis.

We need reform. Yesterday.

(Yes, I know this is controversial. CMV.)
```

**Media suggestion:** None - text-only hot takes perform well

## Post 2.3
**Platform:** Twitter  
**Account:** @AJTraxler  
**Day/Date:** Day 2 (Tuesday)  

**Copy:**
```
What building a DeSci company actually looks like:

- 47 open browser tabs
- A whiteboard that makes sense to exactly 3 people
- Slack messages at 2am about follicle density
- More coffee than any human should consume
- Random moments of "holy shit this might actually work"

Worth it.
```

**Account:** @VerbinnenAndrew  
**Day/Date:** Day 3 (Wednesday)  

**Copy:**
```
New paper dropped that everyone's missing:

"Wnt/β-catenin Signaling in Hair Follicle Regeneration"

TL;DR: We might be able to wake up dormant follicles, not just protect existing ones.

This is a big deal. Here's why 🧵
```

```
Most treatments focus on:
→ Keeping hair you have
→ Slowing loss

This research suggests:
→ Reactivating follicles you've already lost
→ True regeneration

Different game entirely.
```

```
The mechanism:

Wnt signaling tells stem cells "time to become hair."

In balding areas, this signal weakens.

If we can boost it locally? Dormant follicles could wake up.

We're exploring topical delivery systems at @HairDAO_. Early days, but promising.
```

**Media suggestion:** Link to the paper, simple diagram of Wnt signaling pathway if available

**Account:** @andrew_bakst  
**Day/Date:** Day 3 (Wednesday)  

**Copy:**
```
Elon tweets about neural interfaces while ignoring that we still can't reliably regrow hair.

We've been to the moon. We have AI. We cured Hepatitis C.

But 2024's hair loss treatments are basically the same as 1997's.

This market is begging to be disrupted.

MYTH: Hair loss products need to be used forever or your hair falls out immediately

FACT: Some treatments maintain; some regenerate. Know the difference.

Minoxidil? Use or lose.
Finasteride? Gradual return to baseline.
Regenerative therapies? We're working on permanent solutions.

The future isn't lifelong dependency.

```
It's Friday night.

You've been wearing the same hat for 3 weeks straight.

Your barber asks "the usual?" and you panic because there's less usual every month.

Take the protocol. Protect what's left. Build what's possible.

The weekend can wait. Your follicles can't. 🔑

People ask why I started a hair loss company.

Here's the real answer:

My roommate freshman year cried in the bathroom over his hairline. He was 19.

Society told him it was vanity to care. To "just shave it." To "be confident."

Bullshit.

You're allowed to want your hair back.

Saturday hair care tip:

Your pillowcase matters more than you think.

Silk/satin = less friction = less breakage = happier follicles

Takes 10 seconds to swap. Costs $20.

Small edges add up. This is a marathon, not a sprint.

What's your weekend hair routine?

**Copy:**
```
Sunday thoughts:

Every industry that gets disrupted has the same pattern:

1. Incumbents optimize for profit over outcomes
2. Customers accept mediocrity as normal
3. Someone builds the obvious better thing
4. Everyone asks "why didn't this exist before?"

Hair loss is at step 3.

We're the obvious better thing. A newsletter on what's actually happening in hair science is coming. No sponsors. No BS. Just research and real talk.

Drop a "🔬" if you want early access.

# ENGAGEMENT PROMPTS
## Replies to Post on Industry Accounts

Use these to engage with relevant accounts and build visibility:

---

### For dermatology/medical accounts posting about hair loss:
```
This is great, but the real question is - why aren't we funding more regenerative research? The DHT-blocking paradigm is 30 years old. Time for new approaches.
```

### For influencers sharing hair loss struggles:
```
The fact that you're talking about this openly matters. 80M Americans deal with this in silence. Visibility = normalization = better research funding.
```

### For skeptics/critics of hair loss treatments:
```
You're not wrong that most products are scams. That's exactly why we need transparent, community-driven research. Check what @HairDAO_ is building - different model entirely.
```

### For people asking "what actually works?":
```
Honest answer: depends on your situation. DHT blockers + minoxidil work for most. Newer stuff (microneedling, exosomes) showing promise. Happy to share our research wiki if you want to go deep.
```

### For biotech/DeSci accounts:
```
Hair loss is the perfect DeSci use case. Massive unmet need, broken incentives, patients willing to fund research. @HairDAO_ proving the model works.
```

### For finasteride horror story posts:
```
Side effects are real and valid. That's why we need more options, not fewer. Topical delivery, alternative pathways, regenerative approaches. The answer isn't "just accept it."
```

### For competitors or other hair loss brands:
```
More players = more innovation = better for patients. We don't need to compete - we need to expand the pie. Good luck building 🤝
```

### Generic engagement (on any relevant post):
```
Following this. We're working on similar problems at @HairDAO_ - would love to exchange notes sometime.
```
