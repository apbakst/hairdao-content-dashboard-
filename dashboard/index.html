We're testing microneedle patches that deliver dutasteride directly to your scalp.

🧵 Thread:

1/ Oral dutasteride works. It blocks 99% of DHT vs 70% for finasteride.

But it goes everywhere — your scalp, bloodstream, brain, prostate.

5-10% of users get side effects. Some serious.

2/ The problem isn't the drug. It's the delivery.

What if we could get dutasteride TO the follicle without flooding your system?

3/ Enter: microneedle patches.

Tiny 500-micron needles create micro-channels in the skin. Drug-loaded tips dissolve in the dermis.

Result: high scalp concentration, 90% lower blood levels.

4/ We're running a Phase 1/2 trial now.

• 100 participants
• Fully remote
• Patches shipped to your door
• $750 + 5,000 $HAIR compensation

23 spots filled. Apply: hairdao.xyz/clinical

5/ This is what DeSci looks like.

Community-funded. Open research. Aligned incentives.

If it works, you don't just get your hair back.

"Why is your dad bald?"

It's not because he wore hats.

It's DHT — a hormone that shrinks hair follicles.

Some people are genetically sensitive to it.

If your dad is bald, there's a 50% chance you will be too.

But here's the thing — we can block DHT now.

It's not the 1990s anymore.

Finasteride: $10/month
Minoxidil: $15/month

The $4 billion industry profits from:
- Expensive "hair systems"
- Unproven supplements
- Overpriced branded generics

The actual science is cheap.
