### Day 8 (Monday) - Product & Vision

**@HairDAO_** (8am EST)
Tired of waiting for Big Pharma to care about your hair?

We're building the future of hair loss treatment—open source, community-driven, and actually affordable.

**@HairDAO_** (6pm EST)
The hair loss industry doesn't want you to know this:

Most "breakthrough" treatments are just repackaged minoxidil with a 500% markup.

We're different. And we can prove it.

**@andrew_bakst** (12pm EST)
1/ DeSci isn't just a buzzword. It's how we fix broken healthcare.

Here's why decentralized research matters for hair loss (and everything else):

🧵👇

2/ Traditional pharma spends $2.6B to bring ONE drug to market.

Most of that? Bureaucracy. Middlemen. FDA theater.

The actual science? Maybe 10% of the cost.

3/ DeSci flips this.

Open protocols. Community funding. Transparent trials.

No gatekeepers deciding which research "deserves" to exist.

4/ For hair loss specifically:

Big Pharma abandoned you. The market is "too small" for real innovation.

So we built our own research pipeline. 

Patient-funded. Patient-owned. Patient-first.

5/ The results speak for themselves:

- 3 novel compounds in development
- 12 clinical trials funded
- Zero boardroom executives deciding your fate

This is what medicine should look like.

6/ Critics say it's "unregulated."

I say: the current system gave us the opioid crisis and $1,000 insulin.

Maybe it's time to try something new.

**@VerbinnenAndrew** (10am EST)
Let's talk about something most dermatologists won't explain:

Why your hair follicles miniaturize.

It's not just "genetics." It's a cascade of inflammatory signals, DHT sensitivity, and fibrosis.

Here's the full picture 🧵

1/ DHT (dihydrotestosterone) gets all the blame.

But DHT is just the trigger.

The real damage? Chronic inflammation that transforms your hair follicles into tiny, useless structures.

2/ Here's what actually happens:

DHT → Inflammatory cytokines → Fibrosis → Follicle miniaturization

Block any step in this chain, and you can slow or reverse the process.

3/ This is why combination therapies outperform single treatments.

Finasteride blocks DHT.
Minoxidil increases blood flow.
But neither addresses fibrosis.

The next generation of treatments will.

4/ At HairDAO, we're researching compounds that target:
- TGF-β (fibrosis driver)
- Prostaglandin pathways
- Wnt signaling (follicle regeneration)

Science moves faster when it's open.

### Day 9 (Tuesday) - Meme Day + Metrics

**@HairDAO_** (8am EST)
Big Pharma developing hair loss treatments:

"We need 15 years, $3 billion, and we might have something that works 30% of the time."

HairDAO:

"We crowdfunded it, published the research, and you can buy it now."

Different breed.

📷 Media: Drake meme format - Big Pharma rejected, HairDAO approved

---

**@HairDAO_** (2pm EST)
They told us DeSci couldn't compete with Big Pharma.

Our response:

📈 47,000+ community members
📈 $2.1M in research funded
📈 6 treatments in development
📈 0 shareholders to answer to

We're just getting started.

**@AJTraxler** (12pm EST)
Last month at HairDAO:

✅ Shipped 3 product updates
✅ Onboarded 2,400 new users
✅ Funded 2 new research initiatives
✅ Hired 3 team members (more coming)

Building in public means you see the real numbers.

What should we focus on next?

**@andrew_bakst** (4pm EST)
Someone in my replies said "DeSci is just crypto bros playing scientist."

Let me be clear:

Our chief scientist has 15 years in dermatological research.
Our advisory board includes former FDA reviewers.
Our clinical trials follow ISO standards.

The difference? We don't charge you $500/month for hope.

Next question.

📷 Media: None needed - this is a clap-back, let it stand alone

**@VerbinnenAndrew** (10am EST)
Community question from @[user]:

"Is topical finasteride really better than oral?"

Great question. Let me break it down:

1/ Systemic exposure is ~10x lower with topical
2/ Local DHT suppression is similar (70-80%)
3/ Side effect profile is significantly better

For most people? Topical is the smarter choice.

But—and this is important—formulation matters. Most topical fins on the market have poor penetration.

Ours uses liposomal delivery. That's why it works.

**@andrew_bakst** (12pm EST)
Unpopular opinion:

Most "hair loss experts" on social media are just affiliate marketers with a ring light.

They recommend whatever pays the highest commission, not what actually works.

We publish our research. We show our data. We let results speak.

That's the difference.

📷 Media: None - let the hot take breathe

### Day 14 (Sunday) - Education + Vision

**@HairDAO_** (10am EST)
Everything you need to know about minoxidil 🧵

A thread:

1/ Minoxidil was originally a blood pressure medication.

The hair growth was a "side effect."

Now it's the most prescribed hair loss treatment in the world.

2/ How it works:

- Increases blood flow to follicles
- Opens potassium channels
- Extends the anagen (growth) phase

It doesn't block DHT. That's why it works best with finasteride.

3/ Oral vs topical:

Oral is more effective but comes with more side effects.
Topical is localized but requires consistent application.

Choose based on your risk tolerance.

4/ The truth about "not responding":

30% of people are "non-responders."

Why? They lack the enzyme (sulfotransferase) that activates minoxidil.

Solution: Topical formulations with pre-activated minoxidil sulfate.

(Yes, we have this.)

5/ Common mistakes:

- Applying too much (more ≠ better)
- Expecting results in 2 weeks (takes 4-6 months)
- Stopping when you see shedding (that's normal at first)

6/ The bottom line:

Minoxidil works. It's not magic, but it's effective.

Combine it with other treatments, stay consistent, and give it time.

**@andrew_bakst** (12pm EST)
1/ Why patient empowerment matters:

A thread 🧵

2/ The traditional model:
- Doctor prescribes
- You comply
- No questions asked

The problem? Your doctor has 15 minutes and 30 other patients.

3/ The empowered model:
- You research options
- Doctor collaborates
- Decisions are shared

Better outcomes. Every study shows this.

4/ At HairDAO, we give you:
- Access to the actual research
- Community knowledge from 47,000 members
- Tools to track your own progress

You become your own advocate.

5/ This scares some doctors.

Good doctors? They welcome informed patients.

If your provider is threatened by your questions, find a new provider.

6/ The future of medicine is collaborative.

Patients aren't passive recipients anymore.

We're partners in our own health.

**@VerbinnenAndrew** (10am EST)
Most common question I get:

"Is my hair loss genetic or something else?"

Quick diagnostic thread 🧵

1/ Pattern matters:

- Receding temples + crown = Androgenetic (genetic)
- Patchy spots = Could be alopecia areata (autoimmune)
- Diffuse all-over = Check thyroid, nutrition, stress

2/ Family history:

Look at BOTH sides.

Mom's dad losing hair? You might too.
Dad has a full head at 60? Good sign.

But genetics isn't destiny. Environment matters.

3/ Age of onset:

Started before 25? Usually genetic, often aggressive.
Started after 40? Might be slower, more manageable.

4/ Other symptoms:

Fatigue? Thyroid.
Weight changes? Hormonal.
Itchy scalp? Possible dermatitis.

Hair loss is often a symptom, not the root cause.

5/ The bottom line:

Get a proper diagnosis before treating.

Generic advice doesn't work. Personalized protocols do.

**@andrew_bakst** (6pm EST)
Hot take:

The "hair transplant industrial complex" doesn't want you to try medical treatments first.

Because successful medical treatment = no $15,000 surgery.

Always try medical options before going under the knife.

That's not what they want you to hear.

### Day 18 (Thursday) - Testimonial + AMA

📷 Media: Testimonial quote graphic

---

**@andrew_bakst** (12pm EST)
Unpopular opinion thread 🧵

Things I believe that most hair loss "experts" disagree with:

1/ Finasteride fears are overblown.

The nocebo effect is real. Most side effects in studies? Identical between drug and placebo.

If you have concerns, start with topical.

2/ Hair transplants are oversold.

They're a tool, not a cure. Without medical treatment, you'll keep losing hair around the transplant.

Clinics don't emphasize this enough.

3/ Natural "alternatives" are mostly cope.

Saw palmetto, biotin, rosemary oil—minimal evidence for meaningful regrowth.

Fine as additions. Not as replacements.

4/ You don't need a dermatologist to start.

Especially for early-stage loss. The first-line treatments are well-documented.

Save the specialist for complex cases.

5/ Community knowledge > individual doctors.

47,000 people sharing results beats one doctor with 20 hair loss patients.

Collective intelligence wins.

Top questions from last night:

Q: "Can I stack minoxidil and finasteride?"
A: Yes—it's actually recommended. Different mechanisms, synergistic effects.

Q: "When should I expect results?"
A: 4-6 months minimum. 12 months for full effect. Patience is key.

Q: "What about microneedling?"
A: Strong evidence for boosting topical absorption. We recommend 1.5mm depth, weekly.

3/ Results:

Compound-7: 23% more hair count vs minoxidil
Time to visible improvement: 40% faster
Side effects: Comparable to placebo

4/ Why we're excited:

This is the first truly novel hair loss compound in 20 years.

Developed by community. Funded by community. Owned by community.

This is DeSci working.

FAQ: "Can I use Compound-7 with my current regimen?"

Yes! Compound-7 stacks well with:
✅ Finasteride (oral or topical)
✅ Minoxidil (though overlap in some mechanisms)
✅ Microneedling (actually enhances absorption)

The response has been overwhelming.

2,400 orders in 12 hours.

But here's what matters more:

50+ people have already shared their "before" photos in our community.

They're committed. They believe.

Let's make this work.

Thread on the bigger vision 🧵

Compound-7 is just the start.

1/ Hair loss was our proving ground.

We showed that community-driven research can produce real treatments.

Now we scale.

2/ Next up:

- Skin conditions (acne, rosacea)
- Metabolic health
- Longevity research

Same model. Patient-funded. Patient-owned.

3/ The infrastructure is built:

- Research coordination
- Clinical trial management
- Manufacturing partnerships
- Distribution network

Other communities can use our playbook.

4/ Imagine a world where:

- Rare disease patients fund their own research
- Treatments are priced at cost + sustainable margin
- Big Pharma has to compete with patients

That world is closer than you think.

5/ HairDAO proved it's possible.

Who's next?

Start building.
