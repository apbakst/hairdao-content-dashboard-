## 🧵 MAIN THREAD (12 tweets)

### 1/ THE HOOK
The hair loss industry has a dirty secret:

Every FDA-approved treatment that actually works... also tanks your hormones.

We just generated data that could change that.

Here's what we found 👇

### 2/ THE PROBLEM
Oral finasteride and dutasteride work. They're the gold standard.

But they nuke your systemic DHT levels:
- Finasteride: ~70% reduction
- Dutasteride: ~90% reduction

Your hair isn't the only tissue that uses DHT.

**[MEDIA: Simple infographic showing DHT reduction percentages]**

---

### 3/ WHY IT MATTERS
That systemic DHT crash comes with a price:

- Sexual dysfunction (2-5% in trials, likely underreported)
- Brain fog / cognitive effects
- Depression and anxiety
- "Post-finasteride syndrome" fears

Millions of men choose to go bald rather than risk it.

### 4/ WHAT WE BUILT
At @HairDAO, we asked a simple question:

What if we could block DHT *only* in the scalp?

Not your blood. Not your brain. Not your prostate.

Just. The. Scalp.

We built Precision Dutasteride — a topical formulation engineered for local delivery.

### 5/ THE DATA 🔬
We tested it.

Participants applied Precision Dutasteride daily for [X weeks].

Systemic DHT levels: **[INSERT DHT % — e.g., "Within 5% of baseline" or "No statistically significant change"]**

For comparison, oral dutasteride crashes DHT by 90%+.

This is the whole ballgame.

### 6/ WHAT THIS MEANS
If systemic DHT stays intact while scalp DHT is suppressed:

✅ Hair follicle protection (where it matters)
✅ Systemic hormones untouched
✅ Side effect profile potentially transformed

This is the decoupling we've been chasing.

### 7/ HOW IT WORKS
Traditional topicals fail because dutasteride crosses into bloodstream anyway.

Our approach:
- Optimized vehicle for follicular penetration
- Formulation that limits systemic absorption
- [Any other mechanism you can share]

Targeted delivery. Localized effect.

### 8/ THE HONEST CAVEAT
"But does it regrow hair?"

We don't know yet.

This study measured *safety and systemic exposure* — not efficacy.

Regrowth data requires longer trials with proper endpoints. That work is ongoing.

We're sharing what we have, not what we wish we had.

**[MEDIA: Timeline graphic showing current milestone + future efficacy study]**

---

### 9/ WHY WE'RE SHARING NOW
Most pharma companies would sit on this data until they had a full package.

We're not most companies.

@HairDAO is building in public. DeSci means transparent science.

You funded this research. You deserve to see the results in real-time.

**[MEDIA: HairDAO logo + DeSci/transparency messaging]**

### 10/ WHAT'S NEXT
Upcoming milestones:

📊 Full systemic safety data publication
🔬 Efficacy trial initiation
📈 Longer-term exposure studies
🤝 Regulatory pathway discussions

The unsexy work that turns promising data into real medicine.

### 12/ FINAL HOOK
40 years of hair loss treatment, and we're still choosing between:

A) Accept baldness
B) Risk your hormones

Precision Dutasteride is our bet that there's a third option.

The data is starting to show we might be right.

This is just the beginning. 🧬

## 📱 SHORT VERSION (5 tweets)

### 1/5
Hair loss drugs work, but they crash your systemic DHT by 70-90%.

That's why men fear finasteride side effects.

We built something different. Here's our first data drop 🧵

---

### 2/5
Precision Dutasteride: topical delivery engineered to stay local.

We tested systemic DHT levels after daily use.

Result: **[INSERT DHT % — e.g., "No significant systemic reduction"]**

Oral dutasteride? 90%+ reduction.

---

### 3/5
What this means:

→ Scalp gets DHT protection
→ Blood/brain DHT stays normal
→ Side effect profile potentially transformed

The decoupling everyone's been waiting for.

---

### 4/5
Caveat: This is safety/exposure data, not regrowth data.

Does it grow hair? Trial ongoing.

We're sharing what we know now because that's how @HairDAO works. Transparent science > press release science.
