## Problem Section

### Headline
> ## The DHT Dilemma

### Body Copy

Every hair loss treatment comes with the same impossible choice:

**Option 1: Finasteride** — blocks ~70% of DHT. Works for some. Not enough for many.

**Option 2: Dutasteride** — blocks 99% of DHT. Works better. But it goes *everywhere.*

Your scalp, your blood, your brain. DHT isn't all bad—it plays roles in:

- **Libido and sexual function**
- **Muscle maintenance and recovery**
- **Mood, motivation, and cognitive clarity**

This is why 5-15% of users report side effects. Brain fog. Low energy. Sexual dysfunction. Some serious enough to quit.

You've read the forums. You've seen the horror stories. You've probably avoided dutasteride entirely—even knowing it works better.

**We don't blame you.**

But what if you didn't have to choose between keeping your hair and keeping everything else?

## Solution Section

### Headline
> ## Precision Dutasteride: Full Power. Targeted Delivery.

### Body Copy

Precision Dutasteride uses advanced delivery technology to put medication where it matters—your follicles—and keep it out of where it doesn't.

**How it works:**

1. **Nano-encapsulated formulation** creates micro-particles that penetrate the scalp barrier
2. **Direct follicle delivery** concentrates active compound at the hair root
3. **Minimal systemic absorption** keeps blood and brain levels dramatically lower
4. **Once-daily application** with no pills to swallow

Same molecule. Same 99% DHT blockade at the follicle.

Radically different systemic exposure.

### The Science (Simplified)

Traditional oral dutasteride floods your entire system because that's how pills work—they go everywhere.

Our approach is different. By targeting delivery directly to the dermal papilla (where DHT does its damage), we get **high local concentration** with **low systemic levels**.

Think of it like putting out a fire with a targeted spray instead of flooding the whole house.

**The result:** Follicles get maximum DHT suppression. Your bloodstream doesn't.

### Study Details

| Parameter | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Participants** | [XX] males, ages 18-45 with AGA |
| **Duration** | [XX] weeks |
| **Measurements** | Serum DHT, scalp DHT, side effect surveys |
| **Comparison** | vs. oral dutasteride 0.5mg |

### What We Measured

**Primary endpoints:**
- Serum (blood) DHT levels vs. oral dutasteride
- Scalp tissue DHT concentration
- Side effect incidence and severity

**Secondary endpoints:**
- Hair density (macro photos)
- Self-reported satisfaction
- Treatment compliance

### The Headline Number

> **[XX]% reduction in systemic DHT exposure**
> compared to equivalent oral dosing—
> while maintaining [XX]% scalp DHT suppression.

*This isn't a different drug. It's the same drug, delivered smarter.*

## FAQ Section

### Headline
> ## Questions? We've Got Answers.

---

**Q: Does it regrow hair?**

We're focused on the safety data first. Precision Dutasteride delivers the same active compound that's proven to stop—and often reverse—hair loss in clinical studies.

What we've proven: dramatically reduced systemic exposure with maintained scalp activity.

What we're studying next: comparative regrowth data vs. oral dutasteride.

Early signs are promising. But we won't claim regrowth until we have the data to prove it.

---

**Q: How is this different from topical finasteride?**

Two key differences:

1. **Different molecule.** Dutasteride blocks 99% of DHT (both Type I and II 5α-reductase). Finasteride only blocks ~70% (Type II only). For many people, that gap matters.

2. **Different delivery tech.** Most topical finasteride products still get significant systemic absorption—often 30-50% of oral levels. Our precision delivery system keeps systemic exposure dramatically lower.

TLDR: More powerful drug. Better delivery. Less systemic exposure.

---

**Q: What about side effects?**

Our data shows [XX]% of users reported zero side effects over [XX] weeks.

The most commonly reported issue was mild scalp irritation at the application site (typically resolving within the first 2 weeks).

Sexual side effects, brain fog, fatigue, and mood changes—the things people fear most about dutasteride—were reported at rates [statistically indistinguishable from placebo / dramatically lower than oral / placeholder for real data].

---

**Q: When will full regrowth data be available?**

We're running a [XX]-month study measuring hair density and count. Expected completion: [Q# 20XX].

When the data is ready, you'll be the first to know. We're committed to transparency—good results or bad, we publish everything.

**Q: How do I get it?**

**Q: Is this FDA approved?**

Dutasteride is an FDA-approved medication (branded as Avodart for prostate enlargement). Our formulation is compounded in FDA-registered facilities using the same active pharmaceutical ingredient.

Like all compounded medications, our specific formulation is not separately FDA-approved—but it uses approved ingredients in a novel delivery system.

---

**Q: Do I need a prescription?**

Yes. Precision Dutasteride is a prescription medication. Our process includes a telemedicine consultation to ensure it's right for you.
