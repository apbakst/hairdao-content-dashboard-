### Tweet 1 — Science Education (Wnt Pathway)
```
Your hair follicle is basically a tiny stem cell factory.

The Wnt/β-catenin pathway tells these cells "keep growing hair."

When it shuts down → miniaturization → hair loss.

We're funding research to reactivate it.

DeSci doesn't wait for pharma. hairdao.xyz
```

### Tweet 2 — Twist-1/2 Inhibitors (Research Update)
```
Why can't some balding areas regrow hair no matter what you throw at them?

The answer might be Twist-1 and Twist-2 proteins — they create fibrotic tissue that blocks new follicles.

We're testing 11 different inhibitors to reverse this.

Progress update: hairdao.xyz/research
```

### Tweet 3 — Meme/Relatable
```
Stages of hair loss acceptance:

1. "It's just the lighting"
2. "Maybe I slept on it weird"  
3. "I'll just style it differently"
4. *orders everything on Amazon*
5. "I should try actual science"

Welcome to stage 5. hairdao.xyz
```

### Tweet 4 — Community Spotlight
```
This week in the HairDAO Discord:

• 3 new research proposals submitted
• T4 trial participants sharing progress pics (looking good 👀)
• Heated debate on rosemary oil (conclusion: weak evidence, but cheap)

Join 12,000+ members actually doing something about it.
```

### Tweet 5 — Lexy Tool Promo
```
Patent lawyers: "That'll be $20,000 for your formulation filing"

Us: "What if AI did the first draft in 60 seconds?"

Lexy generates patent claims for drug formulations covering:
→ Dosing ranges
→ Delivery methods
→ Manufacturing processes

### Tweet 6 — Educational (DHT Explained Simply)
```
DHT Explained Like You're 5:

Your body makes a hormone called DHT.
Some people's hair follicles HATE it.
When DHT shows up, those follicles shrink.
Eventually they give up and stop making hair.

The fix: block DHT before it gets there.

That's literally it.
```

### Tweet 7 — Stat/Impact
```
Hair loss R&D receives 0.004% of early-stage funding.

That's $5.4M/year globally.

For a condition affecting:
→ 80% of men
→ 50% of women

The math doesn't math.

HairDAO has funded $2.4M+ because pharma won't.

Own the cure: hairdao.xyz
```

### Tweet 8 — Trial Recruitment (Naltrexone Study)
```
New trial: Topical Naltrexone for hair growth

Yes, the addiction medication.

Why? Opioid receptors exist in hair follicles. Blocking them showed 40% growth increase in lab studies.

Now we're testing it on humans.

50 spots. $400 + 2,000 $HAIR compensation.

### Tweet 9 — Meme (Self-Deprecating)
```
POV: You finally found a treatment that works

*6 months of consistency*

Barber: "Wow your hair looks thicker"

You, trying to play it cool: "Oh really? I hadn't noticed"

You, internally: 🎆🎇🎉🥳🔥💪
```

### Tweet 10 — DeSci Philosophy
```
Traditional pharma model:
1. Spend $2B developing drug
2. Charge $500/month to recoup costs
3. Patients can't afford it

DeSci model:
1. Community funds research
2. Community owns the IP
3. Treatments accessible to all

This is why we exist. hairdao.xyz

## TikTok (@anagen.xyz)

### TikTok 1 — "Things Hair Loss Companies Don't Tell You"
**Duration:** 45 sec
**Style:** Fast-paced, direct to camera

**Script:**
```
"Things hair loss companies won't tell you"

1. Most supplements are worthless. Biotin only helps if you're deficient. Most people aren't.

2. That "proprietary blend"? Probably just rebranded minoxidil.

3. Your hairline won't grow back. The best you can do is keep what you have and thicken the miniaturized hairs.

4. Side effects from finasteride? Real, but affect ~2% of users. Most fear is from Reddit, not research.

5. The most effective treatment costs $30/month. Everything else is marketing.

Link in bio if you want the science without the BS.

"It won't be perfect. But it'll be better."

"Microneedling helped me" — 7/10, evidence supports it

"Finasteride ruined my life" — 3/10, rare, anecdotal, check the actual studies

"RU58841 is the answer" — 5/10, unregulated, limited safety data

"Get a consultation first" — 10/10, actually smart

"Rosemary oil is as good as minoxidil" — 4/10, one small study, calm down

The internet has opinions. We have science.

### TikTok 5 — "The Shed Explained"
**Duration:** 30 sec
**Style:** Educational with graphics

**Script:**
```
"Help my treatment is making me LOSE MORE HAIR"

*dramatic pause*

This is The Shed. It's normal. Here's why:

Hair grows in cycles: growth, rest, shed.

Treatment syncs up your follicles.

Weak hairs in "rest phase" get pushed out early.

Strong hairs replace them.

It looks worse before it looks better.

Trust the process. 3 months minimum.
