# HairDAO/Anagen Hashtag Strategy
*Last Updated: 2026-01-26*

---

## Overview

This document outlines the strategic use of hashtags across platforms for maximum reach and engagement while maintaining brand consistency.

---

## Platform-Specific Guidelines

### Twitter (@HairDAO_)

**Philosophy:** Less is more. Twitter's algorithm doesn't favor hashtag-heavy posts.

| Use Case | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| Standard tweets | 0-1 hashtags |
| Research updates | #DeSci |
| Trial announcements | #ClinicalTrial or none |
| Industry commentary | #hairloss (sparingly) |

**Primary Hashtags:**
- `#DeSci` — Our space, our movement
- `#hairloss` — When targeting the broader community

**Avoid:** Stacking multiple hashtags, looks spammy on Twitter

---

### Instagram (@anagen.xyz)

**Philosophy:** Strategic hashtag use for discoverability. Use 5-8 per post (not 30).

**Tier System:**

**Tier 1: High Competition / Broad Reach (use 1-2)**
| Hashtag | Posts | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| #hairloss | 5M+ | Main discovery hashtag |
| #hairgrowth | 4M+ | Positive framing |
| #menshealth | 10M+ | Broader lifestyle |
| #selfcare | 50M+ | General wellness |

**Tier 2: Medium Competition / Targeted (use 2-3)**
| Hashtag | Posts | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| #thinninghair | 500K+ | Specific condition |
| #recedingairline | 200K+ | Specific pattern |
| #hairlosstreatment | 300K+ | Solution-seeking |
| #balding | 400K+ | Direct condition |
| #hairrestoration | 200K+ | Treatment category |

**Tier 3: Low Competition / Niche (use 2-3)**
| Hashtag | Posts | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| #dutasteride | 50K | Specific treatment |
| #finasteride | 100K | Specific treatment |
| #minoxidilresults | 80K | Results-focused |
| #hairtransplant | 300K | Related search |
| #hairlosssolution | 100K | Solution-focused |

**Tier 4: Brand & Movement (use 1)**
| Hashtag | Posts | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| #desci | Growing | Our movement |
| #hairdao | Owned | Brand hashtag |
| #anagen | Owned | Brand hashtag |

---

### TikTok (@anagen.xyz)

**Philosophy:** Fewer, more strategic hashtags. Algorithm prioritizes content quality over hashtag optimization.

**Core Hashtags (always include 1-2):**
| Hashtag | Views | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| #fyp | Billions | Required for reach |
| #hairtok | 3B+ | The community |
| #hairloss | 2B+ | Main topic |

**Supporting Hashtags (rotate 1-2):**
| Hashtag | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| #baldtok | Relatable content |
| #learnontiktok | Educational content |
| #healthtok | Wellness category |
| #menshealth | Male audience |
| #skincare | Adjacent interest |
| #groomingtips | Lifestyle |

**Trending Variations:**
- Always check current trending sounds and pair with appropriate hashtags
- Example: If using trending sound, add trending hashtag if relevant
