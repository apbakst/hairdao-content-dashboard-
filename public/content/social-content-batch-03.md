### Template D — Twitter Thread Testimonial
```
1/ A year ago I was convinced I'd be bald by 30.

Today I have more hair than I did at 25.

Here's what actually worked (thread) 🧵

2/ Background: My hair started going at 23. By 27, I could see my scalp through my crown in photos.

I tried: biotin, rosemary oil, "thickening" shampoos, massaging my scalp for 10 minutes a day.

Results: Zero.

3/ What changed: I stopped treating symptoms and addressed the cause.

For me that meant:
- Topical dutasteride (blocks 99% of DHT locally)
- Minoxidil (blood flow to follicles)
- Microneedling 1x/week

4/ The timeline was brutal:

Month 1: Nothing
Month 2-3: Shedding MORE hair (??)
Month 4: Vellus hairs appearing
Month 6: Others started noticing
Month 9: I started believing it

5/ What I wish I knew:
- The shed is REAL and SCARY but temporary
- Photos are your only reliable metric
- Consistency > intensity
- Reddit fear-mongering is not science

6/ Today: I don't think about my hair anymore.

That's the real win.

If you're where I was — DM me or check @HairDAO_ / @anagen.xyz

It's not hopeless. But you have to start.
