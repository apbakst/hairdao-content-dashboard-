### Tweet 2 — T4 Trial Recruitment
```
We're running a clinical trial on T4 (levothyroxine) for hair regrowth.

Yes, the thyroid medication.

Why? Hair follicles have thyroid hormone receptors. Topical T4 may wake up dormant follicles without systemic effects.

Recruiting now: 47/150 spots filled
Compensation: $500 + 2,500 $HAIR

DM to apply 👇
```

### Tweet 3 — DeSci Education
```
The last FDA-approved hair loss drug was finasteride.

In 1997.

28 years. Zero new mechanisms.

Why? No profit incentive. Both approved drugs are generic.

This is exactly why DeSci exists.

HairDAO is running 6 trials RIGHT NOW that pharma won't fund.

Own the cure. hairdao.xyz
```

### Tweet 4 — Microneedle Thread
```
What if you could block 99% of DHT without pills?

We're testing microneedle patches that deliver dutasteride directly to your scalp.

🧵 Thread on why this matters:
```
**Thread:**
```
1/ Oral dutasteride works. It blocks 99% of DHT vs 70% for finasteride.

But it goes everywhere — your scalp, bloodstream, brain, prostate.

5-10% of users get side effects. Some serious.

2/ The problem isn't the drug. It's the delivery.

What if we could get dutasteride TO the follicle without flooding your system?

3/ Enter: microneedle patches.

Tiny 500-micron needles create micro-channels in the skin. Drug-loaded tips dissolve in the dermis.

Result: high scalp concentration, 90% lower blood levels.

4/ We're running a Phase 1/2 trial now.

• 100 participants
• Fully remote
• Patches shipped to your door
• $750 + 5,000 $HAIR compensation

23 spots filled. Apply: hairdao.xyz/clinical

5/ This is what DeSci looks like.

Community-funded. Open research. Aligned incentives.

If it works, you don't just get your hair back.

You own a piece of the cure.

### TikTok 2 — "Why your dad is bald"
**Duration:** 30 sec
**Style:** Explainer with graphics

**Script:**
```
"Why is your dad bald?"

It's not because he wore hats.

It's DHT — a hormone that shrinks hair follicles.

Some people are genetically sensitive to it.

If your dad is bald, there's a 50% chance you will be too.

But here's the thing — we can block DHT now.

It's not the 1990s anymore.

Link in bio.
```

### TikTok 3 — "Hair loss industry doesn't want you to know"
**Duration:** 45 sec
**Style:** Conspiracy-style hook, then facts

**Script:**
```
"The hair loss industry doesn't want you to know this..."

*pause for effect*

...that the two best treatments have been generic for 20 years.

Finasteride: $10/month
Minoxidil: $15/month

The $4 billion industry profits from:
- Expensive "hair systems"
- Unproven supplements
- Overpriced branded generics

The actual science is cheap.

We just make it easier to access.

Finasteride: 8/10 (actually blocks DHT)
Dutasteride: 9/10 (blocks MORE DHT)
Topical dutasteride: 9.5/10 (fewer side effects)

**Duration:** 60 sec
**Style:** Educational talking head

**Script:**
```
"As someone who's studied this for years, here's what I wish everyone knew about hair loss:

1. It's progressive. It won't stop on its own.

2. The earlier you start treatment, the better your results.

3. Most treatments are actually very safe — the fear is overblown.

4. Consistency matters more than which treatment you pick.

5. You don't need expensive clinics. Telehealth works.

If you're noticing thinning, don't wait.

Your future self will thank you."
```
