## Video 1: Everything Wrong with the Hair Loss Industry
**Platform:** YouTube (long)
**Length:** 5 minutes
**Speaker:** @andrew_bakst

### Hook (first 5 seconds)
"The hair loss industry made $4 billion last year. You know how much went to actual research? Almost nothing."

### Script
- 0:00 - **The Problem**
"The hair loss industry made $4 billion last year. You know how much went to actual research? Almost nothing. I'm Andrew, and today I'm going to tell you everything that's broken about this industry—and why we built HairDAO to fix it."

- 0:30 - **The Money Trail**
"Let's follow the money. You've got three main players: Big Pharma selling you the same two drugs from the 90s, clinics charging $15,000 for transplants with a 6-month waitlist, and supplement companies selling you biotin gummies that do literally nothing for pattern baldness. Sorry, but someone had to say it."

- 1:15 - **The Research Gap**
"Here's what kills me. Finasteride was approved in 1997. Minoxidil? 1988. That's it. Those are your options. In 35 years, we've had exactly zero new FDA-approved treatments for androgenetic alopecia. Why? Because there's no money in curing things—only in treating them forever."

- 2:00 - **The Incentive Problem**
"Think about it. If you're a pharma company, what's your ideal customer? Someone who takes your pill every single day for the rest of their life. A cure? That's terrible for business. You sell it once and you're done. So guess which one gets funded?"

- 2:45 - **The Information Asymmetry**
"And let's talk about the information problem. Have you ever tried to read a hair loss study? Good luck. They're locked behind $40 paywalls, written in jargon nobody understands, and often funded by the companies selling the treatments. Totally unbiased, right?"

- 3:15 - **The Desperation Tax**
"This industry preys on desperation. You're losing your hair, you're panicking, and suddenly someone's selling you a $200 laser cap or a subscription to 'proprietary growth factors' that are basically expensive water. And because you're desperate, you pay. I've been there. It sucks."

- 3:45 - **Why HairDAO Exists**
"This is exactly why we started HairDAO. We're not a company—we're a community of people who got tired of waiting for someone else to fix this. We pool our resources, we fund real research, and we make everything open source. No patents. No paywalls. No profit motive corrupting the science."

- 4:15 - **What We're Actually Doing**
"We've already funded multiple research initiatives. We're working with actual scientists. And every single finding gets published openly for anyone to use. Because here's the thing—your hair loss isn't a business opportunity to us. We're in the same boat."

- 4:45 - **Closing**
"The old model is broken. Waiting for Big Pharma to save us isn't working. So we're doing it ourselves. If you want to be part of the solution instead of just another customer, link's in the description. Let's fix this together."

## Video 2: DHT Explained in 60 Seconds
**Platform:** TikTok (short)
**Length:** 60 seconds
**Speaker:** @VerbinnenAndrew

### Hook (first 5 seconds)
"Your body is literally attacking your hair follicles. Here's why." *points to head*

### Script
- 0:00 - **Hook**
"Your body is literally attacking your hair follicles. Here's why."

- 0:05 - **What is DHT**
"DHT—dihydrotestosterone. It's made from testosterone by an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase. Normally, DHT does useful stuff. But if you've got the genes for pattern baldness..."

- 0:18 - **The Problem**
"...your hair follicles have receptors that are basically DHT magnets. When DHT binds to them, it triggers miniaturization. Your thick terminal hairs slowly become thin, wispy vellus hairs. Then... nothing."

- 0:32 - **The Timeline**
"This doesn't happen overnight. It's years of gradual shrinking. By the time you notice thinning, you've probably already lost 50% of the hair density in that area."

- 0:42 - **What You Can Do**
"Finasteride blocks that enzyme, so less DHT gets made. Minoxidil doesn't touch DHT at all—it just improves blood flow to follicles. That's why some people use both."

- 0:52 - **The Catch**
"But here's the thing—once a follicle is completely miniaturized, it's much harder to bring back. Early intervention matters. Follow for more."

### B-Roll/Visuals

## Video 3: Why Most Hair Loss Treatments Fail
**Platform:** YouTube (long)
**Length:** 3 minutes
**Speaker:** @VerbinnenAndrew

### Hook (first 5 seconds)
"90% of people who try hair loss treatments give up within a year. And it's not because the treatments don't work."

### Script
- 0:00 - **The Statistic**
"90% of people who try hair loss treatments give up within a year. And it's not because the treatments don't work. It's because of three fundamental problems nobody talks about."

- 0:20 - **Problem 1: Unrealistic Expectations**
"Problem one: expectations. You see those before-and-after photos online? The crazy transformations? Those are the top 1%. The outliers. For most people, 'success' means stopping further loss and maybe getting 15-20% regrowth. That's actually a win. But if you expected to go from Norwood 4 to a full head of hair in three months, you're going to be disappointed and quit."

- 0:55 - **Problem 2: The Timeline**
"Problem two: the timeline. Hair grows slow. Like, really slow. You're looking at 4-6 months minimum before you see any real change. And here's the kicker—most treatments cause initial shedding. Your hair gets *worse* before it gets better. If nobody warned you about that, you're going to panic and stop."

- 1:30 - **Problem 3: Consistency**
"Problem three: consistency. These treatments only work if you use them every single day, forever. Miss a week? You're losing ground. Stop completely? Everything you gained reverses. That's a massive commitment, and most people underestimate it."

- 2:00 - **The Real Issue**
"But here's what really bothers me. We only have two mainstream treatments, and both have these issues. Where's the innovation? Where are the treatments that actually work faster, or don't require daily use, or have better response rates? They're stuck in underfunded labs because curing baldness isn't 'serious medicine.'"

- 2:30 - **What HairDAO is Doing**
"That's the gap HairDAO is trying to fill. We're funding research into next-generation treatments. Things like targeted delivery systems, new molecular targets, regenerative approaches. Because you deserve better options than 'take this pill forever and hope for the best.'"

## Video 4: The Science Behind Minoxidil
**Platform:** YouTube (long)
**Length:** 5 minutes
**Speaker:** @VerbinnenAndrew

### Hook (first 5 seconds)
"Minoxidil was originally a blood pressure medication. Then patients started growing hair in weird places. And a billion-dollar industry was born."

### Script
- 0:00 - **The Accidental Discovery**
"Minoxidil was originally a blood pressure medication. Then patients started growing hair in weird places. And a billion-dollar industry was born. I'm going to break down exactly how this drug works, why it works for some people and not others, and what the science actually says."

- 0:30 - **The Basics**
"So minoxidil is what we call a vasodilator. It relaxes blood vessel walls, which lowers blood pressure. The oral version is still used for severe hypertension. But when Upjohn noticed the hair growth side effect, they reformulated it as a topical and marketed it as Rogaine."

- 1:00 - **How It Works (What We Know)**
"Here's the thing—we still don't fully understand how minoxidil grows hair. I know, it's been around since the 80s. But the mechanism is complicated. What we do know: it opens potassium channels in cells, which extends the anagen phase—that's the active growth phase of hair. It also increases blood flow to follicles and may upregulate certain growth factors."

- 1:45 - **The Sulfotransferase Factor**
"But here's the key thing most people don't know: minoxidil is a prodrug. It needs to be converted into minoxidil sulfate to actually work. That conversion happens via an enzyme called sulfotransferase. And here's the kicker—everyone has different levels of this enzyme. If you're a low sulfotransferase producer, topical minoxidil might do almost nothing for you."

- 2:30 - **Response Rates**
"This explains a lot. Studies show only about 40% of people get significant regrowth from minoxidil. Another 40% maintain what they have. And 20%? No response at all. There are actually tests now to check your sulfotransferase levels before starting treatment. Worth looking into."

- 3:00 - **Topical vs. Oral**
"Now, oral minoxidil is making a comeback. Low-dose oral minoxidil—usually 1.25 to 2.5mg—bypasses the sulfotransferase issue because it gets converted systemically. Response rates are higher. But it's also systemic, meaning more potential side effects: water retention, faster heart rate, body hair growth."

- 3:45 - **Practical Advice**
"If you're using topical: twice daily application, minimum 4 months before judging results. Let it dry before bed or you'll get pillow-face. The foam is less irritating than liquid for most people. And yes, the generic works exactly the same as brand name—save your money."

- 4:15 - **The Limitations**
"What minoxidil won't do: it won't block DHT, so it's not addressing the root cause of pattern baldness. That's why many people stack it with finasteride. It also won't bring back completely dead follicles. Once they're gone, they're gone."

- 4:45 - **Closing**
"Minoxidil is a tool. A good tool. But it's not magic, and it's not for everyone. The future of hair loss treatment needs to go beyond 'increase blood flow and hope.' That's exactly what we're researching at HairDAO. Link in description if you want to follow the science."

## Video 5: What Big Pharma Won't Tell You
**Platform:** YouTube (long)
**Length:** 5 minutes
**Speaker:** @andrew_bakst

### Hook (first 5 seconds)
"Pharmaceutical companies have known about potential treatments they'll never develop. Here's why."

### Script
- 0:00 - **The Hidden Truth**
"Pharmaceutical companies have known about potential treatments they'll never develop. And I'm not talking about conspiracy theories—I'm talking about basic economics. Let me show you how the system actually works."

- 0:25 - **The Patent Problem**
"To develop a new drug, you need about 10-15 years and $2-3 billion. That's not an exaggeration. So how do companies make that money back? Patents. You get 20 years of exclusivity to sell your drug at premium prices. But here's the problem: the clock starts when you file the patent, not when you get FDA approval. By the time a drug hits the market, you might only have 7-10 years of exclusivity left."

- 1:00 - **What This Means for Hair Loss**
"Now think about hair loss. It's not life-threatening. It's 'cosmetic.' It affects mostly men, who historically spend less on personal care. The market is big, but the urgency isn't there. If you're a pharma company with limited R&D budget, are you going to spend it on hair loss or on cancer? Heart disease? Diabetes? The math doesn't math."

- 1:45 - **The Natural Compound Problem**
"But it gets worse. Some of the most promising compounds for hair loss are natural substances that can't be patented. Things like certain peptides, existing off-label drugs, plant-derived molecules. No patent means no exclusivity. No exclusivity means no incentive to spend billions on clinical trials. So these compounds just... sit there. In academic papers. Gathering dust."

- 2:30 - **The Off-Label Elephant**
"Speaking of which—oral minoxidil. It's been used off-label for hair loss for years. Works great for many people. But Upjohn's patent expired decades ago. So who's going to pay for the massive clinical trials needed for FDA approval specifically for hair loss? Nobody. There's no money in it. So doctors prescribe it off-label, and patients play guinea pig without proper dosing guidelines."

- 3:15 - **The Combination Therapy Gap**
"Here's another one: combination therapies. What if finasteride plus minoxidil plus low-level laser therapy plus microneedling works better than any single treatment? Probably does. But good luck getting a study funded. Each company only cares about proving their product works. Nobody's paying to prove your product works better with someone else's."

- 3:45 - **What HairDAO Changes**
"This is literally why we exist. HairDAO doesn't care about patents. We're not trying to make money—we're trying to make progress. We can fund research on natural compounds. We can fund combination studies. We can publish everything openly so anyone can use it. We're not playing the pharma game."

- 4:15 - **Our Research Priorities**
"Right now, we're looking at things traditional pharma won't touch. Novel delivery mechanisms. Repurposed drugs. Gene expression modulation. Stuff that's scientifically promising but economically unattractive. Because the goal isn't profit. The goal is results."

- 4:45 - **Closing**
"Big Pharma isn't evil. They're just playing the game they're incentivized to play. But that game isn't designed to help you. HairDAO is designed to help you. If you want to be part of funding the research that actually matters, link's below."

## Video 6: HairDAO vs Traditional Research
**Platform:** YouTube (long)
**Length:** 3 minutes
**Speaker:** @andrew_bakst

### Hook (first 5 seconds)
"Traditional hair loss research takes 15 years and costs billions. We're doing it differently."

### Script
- 0:00 - **The Comparison**
"Traditional hair loss research takes 15 years and costs billions. We're doing it differently. Let me break down exactly how HairDAO works versus the traditional model."

- 0:20 - **Traditional Model**
"Traditional path: A pharma company identifies a target molecule. They spend 3-5 years on preclinical work. Then Phase 1 trials—safety. Phase 2—does it work? Phase 3—does it really work on lots of people? Each phase takes years. Each phase costs hundreds of millions. And at the end, if everything goes perfectly, maybe they file for FDA approval. Most drugs fail somewhere along the way. The ones that succeed? Protected by patents, sold at premium prices, inaccessible to many."

- 1:00 - **The HairDAO Model**
"HairDAO model: We're a decentralized community. We pool resources from thousands of members—people who are personally affected by hair loss and want solutions. We identify promising research that's been ignored by traditional funding. We fund it directly. No shareholders to satisfy. No patent strategy to optimize. Just: does this science have potential? Let's find out."

- 1:30 - **Open Source Everything**
"Here's the key difference: everything we fund gets published openly. No paywalls. No proprietary secrets. If we find something that works, everyone benefits. We're not trying to corner the market. We're trying to expand knowledge."

- 2:00 - **Speed and Flexibility**
"We can also move faster. No bureaucratic approval chains. No quarterly earnings calls. Our community votes on research priorities. Scientists apply for grants. We fund the most promising work. Results come back to the community. Rinse and repeat."

- 2:15 - **What We've Done**
"So far, we've funded research into novel compounds, supported open-source hair loss databases, and built a community of thousands who actually understand the science. This isn't charity—it's collective self-interest. We all want this solved."

- 2:45 - **Closing**
"Traditional research isn't bad. It's just not designed for problems like hair loss. HairDAO is. If you're tired of waiting for someone else to prioritize your problem, come join us. We're not waiting anymore."

## Video 7: Reading a Hair Loss Study
**Platform:** YouTube (long)
**Length:** 5 minutes
**Speaker:** @VerbinnenAndrew

### Hook (first 5 seconds)
"Someone tells you a new treatment has '85% success rate.' Here's why that number is probably meaningless."

### Script
- 0:00 - **The Problem with Headlines**
"Someone tells you a new treatment has '85% success rate.' Here's why that number is probably meaningless. Today I'm teaching you how to actually read a hair loss study so you never get fooled by marketing again."

- 0:25 - **Step 1: Who Funded It?**
"First thing: scroll to the end. Find the conflicts of interest section. Who funded this study? If it's the company selling the treatment being studied, that doesn't automatically mean it's bad—but you should be more skeptical. Industry-funded studies are more likely to have favorable results. That's just statistics."

- 0:55 - **Step 2: Study Design**
"Next: what kind of study is this? Gold standard is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. That means patients don't know if they're getting the real treatment or placebo, doctors evaluating them don't know either, and people were randomly assigned to each group. Anything less, and the results are weaker."

- 1:30 - **Step 3: Sample Size**
"How many people were in the study? 10 people? Basically meaningless. 50? Getting better. 500? Now we're talking. Small sample sizes lead to unreliable results. A treatment might look amazing in 10 people by pure chance."

- 2:00 - **Step 4: Duration**
"How long did the study run? Hair grows slowly. A 12-week study for a hair loss treatment is almost useless. You need at least 6 months, ideally 12 or more. Short studies can make mediocre treatments look good and good treatments look bad."

- 2:30 - **Step 5: What Are They Actually Measuring?**
"This is huge. What's the primary endpoint? Total hair count? Hair density? Hair thickness? Patient satisfaction? 'Hair growth' means different things in different studies. A treatment might increase hair count by 50 hairs but not change how your hair actually looks. Also: where are they measuring? Vertex? Hairline? Those can have very different responses."

- 3:00 - **Step 6: The Statistics**
"Look for the p-value. If it's below 0.05, the result is considered statistically significant—meaning it's unlikely to be random chance. But also look at confidence intervals. A huge range means the true effect could be much bigger or much smaller than reported."

- 3:30 - **Step 7: Effect Size vs. Statistical Significance**
"Something can be statistically significant but clinically meaningless. If a treatment increases hair count by 5 hairs per square centimeter with p<0.01, that's statistically significant. But is it visible? Will you notice? Probably not. Look for effect sizes that actually matter in real life."

- 4:00 - **Step 8: Adverse Events**
"Always read the adverse events section. Side effects get buried in dry clinical language. 'Sexual dysfunction was reported in 2% of participants.' That's actually a big deal. Don't skip this section."

- 4:30 - **Putting It Together**
"So next time someone says 'studies show this treatment works,' ask: What studies? Who funded them? How many people? How long? What did they measure? How strong was the effect? What were the side effects? If they can't answer, they haven't done their homework."

- 4:50 - **Closing**
"At HairDAO, we actually read these studies. Our community includes researchers, doctors, and scientifically literate patients. We don't fall for hype. And we share our analysis openly. Link in description to join the conversation."

## Video 8: My Hair Loss Journey
**Platform:** YouTube (long)
**Length:** 3 minutes
**Speaker:** @andrew_bakst (personal story)

### Hook (first 5 seconds)
"I started losing my hair at 19. And I did everything wrong." *shows old photo*

### Script
- 0:00 - **The Beginning**
"I started losing my hair at 19. And I did everything wrong. This is my story, and hopefully it helps you avoid my mistakes."

- 0:15 - **Denial Phase**
"At first, I just... didn't see it. My mom mentioned it. I said she was crazy. My friends said something. I said it was just the lighting. I spent probably two years in complete denial while my hairline was steadily retreating. Looking back at photos, I don't know how I missed it. I just didn't want to see."

- 0:45 - **Panic Phase**
"Then one day I saw a photo from a bad angle, and I couldn't unsee it anymore. And I panicked. I mean, full panic. Googling for hours. Reading forums at 3am. I bought laser combs, saw palmetto supplements, special shampoos—all the stuff that doesn't actually work. I spent hundreds of dollars on products that did nothing."

- 1:15 - **Finally Getting Real**
"It took me way too long to actually see a dermatologist. When I did, they prescribed finasteride in like ten minutes. I was terrified of the side effects—I'd read all the horror stories online. So I sat on the prescription for months. More time lost. More hair lost."

- 1:45 - **What Actually Worked**
"Eventually I started treatment. Finasteride and minoxidil. And yeah, it helped. Stabilized my loss, got some regrowth in the crown. Was it perfect? No. Did I wish I'd started earlier? Absolutely. Those years of denial cost me hair I'll never get back."

- 2:15 - **Why I Started HairDAO**
"But here's what really got me: through this whole journey, I realized how broken the system was. The misinformation. The predatory products. The lack of new treatments. The paywalled research. I wasn't just dealing with hair loss—I was dealing with an industry that didn't care about solving my problem. So I decided to do something about it."

- 2:40 - **Closing**
"HairDAO isn't just a project to me. It's personal. I don't want other people to go through what I went through—the denial, the scams, the wasted time. We can do better. We are doing better. If you're on this journey too, you're not alone. And you've got a whole community ready to help."

**Hook:** "Your hat is not making you bald. Here's what actually is."

**Script:**
- 0:00: "Your hat is not making you bald. This myth needs to die."
- 0:05: "Pattern baldness is genetic and hormonal. DHT shrinks your follicles over time. Your dad's genes did this, not your Yankees cap."
- 0:15: "Unless you're wearing a hat so tight it's literally cutting off blood flow and causing traction alopecia—which would also be extremely painful—your hat is fine."

**Hook:** "The hair that falls out in the shower was already dead."

**Script:**
- 0:00: "The hair that falls out in the shower was already dead."
- 0:05: "You lose 50-100 hairs per day naturally. They're in the telogen phase—done growing, ready to shed. Shampooing just loosens what was already going to fall."
- 0:15: "If you don't wash your hair for a week, you'll lose the same amount—it'll just all come out at once and freak you out more."
- 0:25: "Wash your hair. Don't wash your hair. Same amount falls out."

**Hook:** "Blame your mom? Actually, blame both parents."

**Script:**
- 0:00: "Blame your mom? Actually, blame both parents."
- 0:05: "Yes, the main baldness gene is on the X chromosome, which you get from mom. But there are over 200 genetic variants linked to hair loss, and they come from both sides."
- 0:18: "Looking at your mom's dad is a clue, not a guarantee. Your dad's genes matter too."
- 0:26: "Genetics is complicated. Sorry."
- 0:30: "Follow for more myth busting."

### Video 9D: Myth #4 - Biotin Supplements Fix Hair Loss

**Hook:** "Biotin companies hate this fact..."

**Script:**
- 0:00: "Biotin companies hate this fact: if you're not biotin deficient, extra biotin does nothing for hair loss."
- 0:08: "Biotin deficiency is extremely rare. Most people get plenty from food. Taking more than you need doesn't make your hair grow faster—you just pee out the excess."
- 0:20: "Pattern baldness is caused by DHT. Biotin doesn't block DHT. It's not even in the same conversation."
- 0:30: "Save your money."
- 0:35: "Follow for more."

**Hook:** "If someone promises fast results, they're lying."

**Script:**
- 0:00: "If someone promises fast hair regrowth, they're lying to you."
- 0:05: "Hair growth cycles take months. Real treatments need 4-6 months minimum to show results. And most cause shedding first—your hair gets worse before it gets better."
- 0:18: "Anyone selling you 'visible results in 2 weeks' is selling you snake oil."
- 0:25: "Real science takes time. There are no shortcuts."

## Video 10: The Future of Hair Loss Treatment
**Platform:** YouTube (long)
**Length:** 5 minutes
**Speakers:** @VerbinnenAndrew and @andrew_bakst

### Hook (first 5 seconds)
**Andrew:** "What if I told you we might cure baldness in the next decade?"
**Verbinnen:** "Let me show you what's actually in the pipeline."

### Script
- 0:00 - **Opening**
**Andrew:** "What if I told you we might cure baldness in the next decade?"
**Verbinnen:** "Let me show you what's actually in the pipeline—not hype, just science."

- 0:20 - **The Current Landscape**
**Verbinnen:** "Right now, we have finasteride, minoxidil, and hair transplants. That's basically it. But there's a whole wave of next-generation treatments in development that work completely differently."

- 0:45 - **Hair Cloning / Cell Therapy**
**Verbinnen:** "First up: hair cloning. Or more accurately, cell-based therapies. The idea is to take a few of your healthy follicles, multiply the dermal papilla cells in a lab, and inject them back to regenerate hair. Companies like Stemson Therapeutics are working on this. The challenge is maintaining the cells' ability to actually induce hair growth when you culture them. We're getting closer."

- 1:30 - **Gene Therapy**
**Andrew:** "Then there's gene therapy. If we know which genes cause susceptibility to DHT, could we edit them? CRISPR makes this theoretically possible. It's early days, and regulatory hurdles are massive, but the science is there. Imagine a one-time treatment that permanently changes how your follicles respond to DHT."

- 2:00 - **JAK Inhibitors**
**Verbinnen:** "JAK inhibitors are exciting. They're already approved for alopecia areata—that's the autoimmune type. For androgenetic alopecia, the data is more mixed, but there's active research. These drugs calm inflammation pathways that might contribute to follicle miniaturization."

- 2:30 - **Wnt Pathway Modulators**
**Verbinnen:** "The Wnt signaling pathway is crucial for hair follicle development. Several companies are targeting this. The tricky part is activating Wnt in hair without causing problems elsewhere—it's also involved in cancer pathways. But targeted delivery systems might solve that."

- 3:00 - **Exosomes and Growth Factors**
**Andrew:** "You've probably seen 'exosome therapy' advertised at clinics. The science behind it is real—exosomes are cellular messengers that could potentially stimulate follicles. But the current clinical offerings are mostly unregulated and unproven. It's a space to watch, not a space to spend thousands on right now."

- 3:30 - **What HairDAO is Focusing On**
**Andrew:** "At HairDAO, we're particularly interested in things that traditional pharma ignores. Combination therapies. Repurposed compounds. Delivery mechanisms that get existing treatments to work better. We're funding research into topical formulations that could improve minoxidil penetration, for example. Not as sexy as gene therapy, but potentially impactful much sooner."

- 4:00 - **Realistic Timeline**
**Verbinnen:** "Let's be real about timelines. Hair cloning? Maybe 5-10 years for something viable. Gene therapy for baldness? Probably longer. But incremental improvements to existing treatments? That's happening now. New delivery systems, optimized protocols, better understanding of responders vs. non-responders—this is where near-term progress lives."

- 4:30 - **Closing**
**Andrew:** "The future of hair loss treatment isn't one magic cure. It's probably going to be personalized medicine—figuring out what works for your specific genetics, your specific pattern, your specific goals."

**Verbinnen:** "And that future gets here faster if we fund it ourselves. That's what HairDAO is about."

**Andrew:** "Join us. Link in description. Let's make that future happen."

# Production Notes

## General Guidelines
- **Authenticity over polish:** These should feel like real people talking, not corporate videos
- **Pacing:** Keep it dynamic. If you feel bored editing, viewers will be bored watching
- **Humor:** Don't force it, but don't be afraid of it. Hair loss is stressful—levity helps
- **Visuals:** Always have something happening on screen. Talking heads alone don't retain viewers

## Platform-Specific
- **TikTok:** Fast cuts, text overlays, vertical framing, hooks in first 2 seconds
- **YouTube:** Can breathe more, but still need strong hooks and chapter markers
- **Both:** Repurpose longer content into shorts with different hooks

## Recording Tips
- Natural lighting preferred
- Shoot extra B-roll—you'll always need more than you think
- Get multiple takes of hooks—they're the most important part
- Room tone audio for smooth edits

## Community Engagement
- Respond to comments with substance
- Pin questions to answer in follow-up videos
- Cross-promote across platforms with platform-native formats
