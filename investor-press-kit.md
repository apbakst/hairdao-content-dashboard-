# SECTION 4: MEDIA KIT

## Company Boilerplate

### Short Version (50 words)
HairDAO is a decentralized science (DeSci) platform that lets patients own their health data, participate in clinical trials, and share in the intellectual property they help create. Governed by the HAIR token, the platform is building the future of patient-centered medical research, starting with hair loss.

### Medium Version (100 words)
HairDAO is the first decentralized clinical research platform that puts patients in control. Through our PlayHair platform, members participate in physician-supervised trials, earn HAIR tokens for their contributions, and own their health data as NFTs they control. Our Anagen telehealth arm delivers cutting-edge compounded treatments directly to patients. Unlike traditional research where participants contribute everything and receive nothing, HairDAO members govern research priorities through token voting and share in the intellectual property they help create. We're replacing the slow, expensive, centralized NIH model with something better: research by the people, for the people.

### Long Version (200 words)
HairDAO is revolutionizing medical research through decentralized science (DeSci). Our platform addresses two fundamental problems: patients have no ownership of their health data, and 80% of clinical trials fail to recruit enough participants.

Through PlayHair, our flagship platform, members participate in IRB-approved, physician-supervised clinical trials from home. They earn HAIR tokens for their contributions, own their health data as blockchain-secured NFTs, and vote on which research gets funded next. When discoveries are made, participants share in the intellectual property they helped create.

Our Anagen telehealth platform delivers the resulting treatments—custom compounded formulations from FDA-registered pharmacies, with monthly subscriptions and physician oversight.

We've already filed patents for novel topical formulations and have 10+ treatments in development, including repurposed compounds showing promise in early research.

HairDAO represents a fundamental shift from the slow, expensive, centralized NIH model to a patient-owned alternative. We believe everyone who contributes to medical research deserves a stake in the cure. Starting with hair loss—a condition affecting 50 million Americans—we're building the infrastructure for a new era of decentralized medical research across all conditions.

# SECTION 5: FAQ FOR INVESTORS

## Business Model & Market

### 1. What problem is HairDAO solving?
**Answer:** Two critical problems. First, patients contribute health data to medical research but receive no ownership stake in the discoveries they enable. Second, 80% of clinical trials fail to recruit enough participants, costing the industry billions. HairDAO aligns incentives by letting participants earn tokens, own their data, and share in IP—solving both problems simultaneously.

### 2. Why start with hair loss?
**Answer:** Hair loss is the perfect beachhead: 50 million Americans affected, high patient motivation (they'll try almost anything), visual results that drive viral word-of-mouth, and a clear pathway to prove the model before expanding. If we can cure hair loss with decentralized research, we can cure anything.

### 3. What's your market size?
**Answer:** Hair loss treatments represent $8.5B globally with 6% CAGR. The clinical trials industry is $65B. DeSci protocols have $500M+ in TVL growing 10x annually. Our Year 1 target is modest: 10K users, 100 trial participants, $500K ARR.

### 4. How do you make money?
**Answer:** Four revenue streams: (1) Treatment subscriptions via Anagen telehealth (60%), (2) Trial sponsorships from pharma/biotech companies (30%), (3) Platform fees on community-funded research (6%), (4) Anonymized data licensing with user royalties (4%). Year 1 target: $500K ARR.

### 5. What are your unit economics?
**Answer:** Treatment customer LTV is $600 (12 months × $50 avg), CAC is $150, giving us 4:1 LTV:CAC. Trial participant value is $1,000 with $200 acquisition cost (5:1). Gross margins are 60%+. We break even at 1,000 paying customers.

## Product & Technology

### 6. What have you built so far?
**Answer:** A complete full-stack platform: PlayHair for clinical trials with gamification, Anagen for telehealth treatments, smart contracts for HAIR token and DataNFTs, payment processing, authentication, and a beautiful UI/UX. 17,000+ lines of production code. We're infrastructure-complete.

### 7. How does the token work?
**Answer:** HAIR is an ERC-20 governance token on Ethereum L2. Users earn it by: participating in trials, contributing data, referring others, and engaging with the platform. They spend it to: vote on research priorities, access premium treatments, and stake for additional rewards. It's a utility token, not a security.

### 8. What makes your data NFTs special?
**Answer:** DataNFTs (ERC-721) give users verifiable ownership of their health data with built-in royalties. When their anonymized data contributes to research, they earn 50% of licensing fees automatically. The NFT travels with them—if they leave HairDAO, their data goes too.

### 9. What's your tech stack?
**Answer:** Next.js 16 with React 19, Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth), Stripe payments, wagmi/RainbowKit for Web3, Ethereum L2 (Optimism/Base), Sentry monitoring, and modern DevOps. We chose proven, scalable technologies—no science experiments in infrastructure.

### 10. What's your competitive advantage?
**Answer:** Four moats: (1) Data network effects—more users means better ML models and recommendations, (2) Token economics—users are locked in through governance and IP ownership, (3) Community brand—first mover in hair loss DeSci, (4) Regulatory compliance—IRB, HIPAA, pharmacy licenses create high barriers to entry.

## Clinical & Regulatory

### 11. How do you handle clinical trial compliance?
**Answer:** All trials are IRB-approved (we're partnering with Advarra, a leading central IRB), physician-supervised, and follow standard clinical protocols. We're not cutting corners—we're making compliant research more efficient by solving recruitment with aligned incentives.

### 12. What's your HIPAA strategy?
**Answer:** Full HIPAA compliance: BAAs with all vendors (Supabase, Stripe, telehealth partners), encryption at rest and in transit, role-based access controls, audit logging, breach notification procedures, and cyber insurance. We treat compliance as a competitive advantage, not a checkbox.

### 13. How do you ensure patient safety?
**Answer:** IRB oversight, licensed physicians supervising all trials, real-time adverse event monitoring, clear protocols for escalation, and comprehensive insurance. We're building trust by being more rigorous than traditional research, not less.

### 14. What's your regulatory risk?
**Answer:** Moderate. The FDA doesn't regulate decentralized infrastructure—they regulate the trials themselves, which we run to spec. Token classification is our main risk; we've structured HAIR as a utility token with clear use cases. We have healthcare attorneys advising throughout.

### 15. Do you have patents?
**Answer:** Yes. We've filed a patent for our T4 (Levothyroxine) topical formulation—a repurposed compound showing promise for hair loss. We have 10+ additional formulations in the pipeline, including proprietary combinations and novel delivery mechanisms.

## Team & Operations

### 16. Who's on your team?
**Answer:** Andrew Bakst (Founder/CEO) leads the company with [background]. We have a committed medical advisory board including board-certified dermatologists, an IRB expert, and a pharmacist. Technical execution is strong with full-stack capability. We're hiring: Full-Stack Engineer, Clinical Ops Manager, Smart Contract Developer.

### 17. What's your hiring plan?
**Answer:** Phase 1 (funded): Full-Stack Engineer ($120-150K), Clinical Operations Manager ($100-130K), Smart Contract Developer ($150-200K contract). Phase 2 (6 months): Head of Growth ($120K + equity), Customer Support ($50-70K). Lean team, high impact.

### 18. Who are your advisors?
**Answer:** Medical advisory board with practicing dermatologists and IRB experience. Technical advisors from established DeSci protocols. Regulatory advisors including healthcare attorneys. We're adding [specific advisor names] as formal advisors.

### 19. What's your burn rate?
**Answer:** $80K/month with current team and operations. Raising $500K-$1M provides 6-12 months runway to key milestones (IRB approval, first trials, 1,000 customers). We're capital efficient and milestone-focused.

### 20. What are your key risks?
**Answer:** In order: (1) IRB approval delays (mitigated by experienced IRB partner, early submission), (2) Token regulatory action (mitigated by utility structure, legal counsel), (3) Smart contract security (mitigated by audits, bug bounty, insurance), (4) Clinical safety incident (mitigated by IRB oversight, medical monitoring). We've identified kill criteria and have contingency plans.

## Objection Handling

### "Crypto is dead/risky"
**Response:** We're building a healthcare company that uses blockchain for data ownership and incentive alignment—not a crypto speculation vehicle. The token enables governance and patient ownership; it's infrastructure, not the product. DeSci is one of the only crypto verticals with clear utility and growing adoption.

### "Clinical trials are too slow/regulated"
**Response:** That's exactly the problem we're solving. Current trials fail because they can't recruit. We solve recruitment by aligning incentives. We're not bypassing regulations—we're making compliant research faster by 10xing participant motivation. IRB approval takes 6-8 weeks, not years.

### "You're not a scientist/doctor"
**Response:** Correct—and that's by design. We're building platform infrastructure for scientists and doctors to run research more efficiently. We have board-certified dermatologists as advisors and licensed physicians supervising all trials. We're the rails, not the train.

### "The market is too small"
**Response:** Hair loss alone is $8.5B. But we're not building a hair loss company—we're building clinical research infrastructure that starts with hair loss. Once we prove the model, we expand to aging, chronic disease, rare conditions. The TAM is the entire $65B clinical trials industry.

### "Why would pharma companies work with you?"
**Response:** Because we solve their biggest problem: 80% of trials fail to recruit. We offer access to motivated, pre-qualified participants with rich data history—at lower cost than traditional CROs. Pharma doesn't care if participants earn tokens; they care about enrollment timelines and data quality.

### "What if someone copies you?"
**Response:** Four moats protect us: (1) Data network effects compound over time, (2) Token holders are locked in via governance and IP ownership, (3) Regulatory compliance (IRB, HIPAA, pharmacy licenses) takes years to replicate, (4) Community brand and trust are earned, not bought. First-mover advantage in DeSci is real.

### "How do you know the treatments work?"
**Response:** We don't claim anything works until we have data. That's literally the point—running real clinical trials to find out. Our T4 patent is based on scientific rationale and early evidence; trials will prove efficacy. We're not selling snake oil; we're funding research to find cures.

### "Token incentives will attract low-quality participants"
**Response:** Token rewards are modest and tied to genuine participation (completing protocols, submitting data, following instructions). Gaming the system would require sustained effort with minimal reward. Our gamification and verification systems identify bad actors. Quality participants earn more because they complete more.

# SECTION 6: OUTREACH TEMPLATES

## Template 1: Cold Email to VC

**Subject:** HairDAO: Patient-owned clinical research (DeSci + Telehealth)

---

Hi [First Name],

I'm Andrew, founder of HairDAO. We're building the first platform where clinical trial participants own their health data and share in the IP they help create.

**The problem:** 80% of clinical trials fail to recruit enough participants, while patients contribute data and receive nothing in return.

**Our solution:** A decentralized platform where participants earn HAIR tokens, own their data as NFTs, and vote on research priorities. We pair this with Anagen, our telehealth arm delivering treatments directly to patients.

**Why now:** DeSci is proving the model (VitaDAO, PsyDAO), but no one's applied it to clinical trials with real telehealth revenue. We have the platform built, a patent filed, and 10+ treatments in pipeline.

**Traction:**
- Full platform live (17K+ lines of code)
- Smart contracts deployed (HAIR token + DataNFT)
- Patent filed (T4 topical formulation)
- IRB approval in progress

We're raising $500K-$1M to launch first trials and hit 1,000 paying customers. [Fund name] has backed [relevant portfolio company], which is why I thought you'd get what we're building.

Would you have 20 minutes this week or next?

Best,
Andrew

## Template 3: Press Pitch Email

**Subject:** Story pitch: The startup trying to replace the NIH with blockchain

---

Hi [Reporter Name],

I read your recent piece on [relevant article topic]—[specific detail that shows you actually read it].

I'm reaching out because I think you'd find HairDAO interesting for a future story.

**The hook:** We're building a platform where clinical trial participants own their health data as NFTs and share in the intellectual property they help create. We're starting with hair loss—a $8.5B market affecting 50 million Americans—but the model applies to all medical research.

**Why it matters:** 80% of clinical trials fail to recruit enough participants. We think it's because the incentives are broken: patients contribute everything and receive nothing. HairDAO fixes that with token rewards, data ownership, and governance rights.

**The bigger picture:** We're part of the "DeSci" (decentralized science) movement that's attracting serious attention—VitaDAO, PsyDAO, and others have raised significant funding. But we're the first to combine clinical trials with a consumer telehealth business.

**What we have:**
- Platform live with patient enrollment
- Patent filed for novel hair loss treatment
- Smart contracts deployed for data ownership
- Raising seed round

I'd love to give you early access for a potential story—whether that's the DeSci trend broadly or our specific journey. Happy to do an interview, share the platform, or just be a source for future pieces.

Let me know if any of this interests you.

Best,
Andrew Bakst

Hi [Host Name/Producer Name],

I've been listening to [Podcast Name] for a while—loved the recent episode with [Guest Name] on [Topic]. [Specific detail that shows you actually listen.]

I'm the founder of HairDAO, and I think my story could resonate with your audience.

**The premise:** I'm building a platform where clinical trial participants own their health data and share in the discoveries they help create. Starting with hair loss (a personal struggle, relatable to millions), but building toward a new model for all medical research.

**Topics I can speak to:**
- Why 80% of clinical trials fail (and how Web3 fixes the incentive problem)
- The DeSci movement: what it is and why it matters
- Data ownership: why you should own your health information
- Building a startup that's both crypto and healthcare (navigating dual regulatory environments)
- The personal journey of turning frustration with hair loss into a company

**My background:**
- Founder/CEO of HairDAO
- [Other relevant credentials]
- [Speaking experience if any]

**Format:** I'm flexible—happy to do a solo deep-dive, debate format, or whatever fits your show. I can go technical (smart contracts, tokenomics) or accessible (patient stories, the vision).

Would this be a fit for an upcoming episode? Happy to send more info or do a quick pre-call.

Best,

## Template 6: Medical Advisor Recruitment

**Subject:** Advisory opportunity: Decentralized hair loss research (HairDAO)

---

Dr. [Name],

I came across your work on [specific research/publication/specialty] and thought you might find what we're building interesting.

I'm Andrew, founder of HairDAO. We're creating a decentralized platform where hair loss patients participate in IRB-approved clinical trials, earn tokens for their contributions, and own their health data.

**Why this matters:**
Traditional trials struggle with recruitment (80% fail). We're solving this by aligning incentives—patients become stakeholders, not just subjects. We believe this model can accelerate hair loss research significantly.

**What we've built:**
- Full clinical research platform with gamification
- Telehealth treatment delivery (Anagen)
- Novel formulations (T4 patent filed, 10+ in pipeline)
- Token economics for patient ownership

**The opportunity:**
We're assembling a Medical Advisory Board to guide our research direction, ensure clinical rigor, and validate our approach. Advisors receive equity compensation and have input on trial design, treatment development, and platform governance.

Time commitment is light—quarterly board meetings plus ad-hoc consultation. We value expertise and credibility over hours.

Would you be open to a brief call to discuss? I'd love to share more about our vision and see if there's a fit.

Best regards,
Andrew Bakst
