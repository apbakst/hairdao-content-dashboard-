**To someone sharing hair loss struggle:**
```
We see you 🤝 Hair loss affects millions and the solutions haven't kept up with the science. That's exactly why we're funding open research. You're not alone in this.
```

**To research/science content:**
```
This is exactly the kind of research we need more of. Open science accelerates breakthroughs. We're funding similar work through community governance → [link]
```

**To someone asking "what is HairDAO?":**
```
We're a decentralized community funding hair loss research 🧬 

Instead of waiting for Big Pharma, we're pooling resources to fund open-source treatments that benefit everyone. 

Check out what we're working on: [link to research page]
```

**To positive mention/support:**
```
Appreciate the love! 🙌 Community support is literally what powers our research. Welcome to the movement.
```

**To someone sharing before/after results:**
```
Love seeing this progress! 💪 Mind sharing what's been working for you? Our community is always learning from each other.
```

### Quote Tweet Strategies

**For Research News:**
```
[Quote tweet]

This is why we exist. Traditional funding takes years. We can move faster by funding open research directly.

Our community has already funded [X] projects tackling hair loss from multiple angles.
```

**For Viral Hair Loss Content:**
```
[Quote tweet]

40% of men and 50% of women experience significant hair loss. It's time we talked about it AND funded real solutions.

That's what we're building at HairDAO 🧬
```

**For Partner/Ecosystem Content:**
```
[Quote tweet]

Proud to be part of the DeSci movement. When communities fund science, everyone benefits.

[Add specific connection to HairDAO work]
```

### Handling Critics & Trolls

**Legitimate Skepticism (ENGAGE):**
```
Fair question! Here's how it works: [brief explanation]. Happy to dive deeper if you want—this stuff matters and healthy skepticism is good.
```

**"Crypto is a scam" generalization:**
```
We get the skepticism—lots of noise in crypto. We're focused on one thing: funding hair loss research. Our treasury, governance, and funded projects are all public. Judge us by results.
```

**Trolling/Bad faith (IGNORE or minimal response):**
```
[If must respond]: We're here for anyone genuinely interested in advancing hair loss treatments. Our research speaks for itself → [link]
```

**Decision Framework:**
| Type | Action |
|------|--------|
| Genuine question | Full, helpful response |
| Skeptic with audience | Thoughtful engagement |
| Troll with no followers | Ignore |
| Troll with big audience | Brief, dignified response then disengage |
| Harassment | Block & report |

## 3. DM Templates

### Inbound Inquiry Responses

**"What is HairDAO?"**
```
Hey! Thanks for reaching out 🙌

Quick version: We're a community funding hair loss research. Instead of waiting for pharma companies, we pool resources and vote on which research gets funded. All results are open-source.

$HAIR token = governance power to decide what we fund.

Best place to learn more:
• Website: [link]
• Discord (for community): [link]

Any specific questions I can answer?
```

**"How do I buy $HAIR?"**
```
Great question! Here's the quick guide:

1. Get ETH in a wallet (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, etc.)
2. Go to [DEX link]
3. Swap ETH for $HAIR
4. Contract address: [address]

Beginner? Here's our step-by-step guide: [link]

Heads up: Always verify contract addresses on our official site. Scammers out there. Stay safe! 🔒
```

**"When moon/price question"**
```
We don't give price predictions—not our style and not really the point.

What we CAN tell you: We're focused on funding research, building community, and hitting milestones. Value follows utility and progress.

If you're interested in what we're actually building vs. just price, check out our research dashboard: [link]

Happy to answer questions about the actual work! 🔬

## 5. Crisis Playbook

### FUD Response Templates

**"It's a scam/rugpull":**
```
We get the skepticism—crypto has earned it.

Here's our track record:
• Team is doxxed: [link to team page]
• Treasury is public: [link]
• [X] research projects funded: [link]
• Governance is on-chain: [link]

We're building in public. Judge us by our actions.
```

**"Research will never work":**
```
Hair loss science has actually made huge progress—the problem is funding and incentives, not possibility.

We're not promising a cure tomorrow. We're funding open research that everyone benefits from, regardless of what we discover.

Worst case: We advance the science. Best case: We help solve a problem affecting billions.
```

**"Token is worthless/utility":**
```
$HAIR = governance power over a treasury funding real research.

Current treasury: $[amount]
Projects funded: [number]
Research updates: [link]

If that's not utility, we're not sure what is. But hey, do your own research.
```

**"Team is anonymous/untrustworthy":**
```
Our core team is fully doxxed:
• [Name, role, LinkedIn]
• [Name, role, LinkedIn]
• [Name, role, LinkedIn]

Plus, governance is decentralized—community votes on major decisions. Trustless > trust us.
```

### Negative Review Handling

**Legitimate Criticism:**
```
Thanks for the honest feedback—this is how we get better.

You're right that [acknowledge valid point]. Here's what we're doing about it: [specific action].

Would love to chat more if you're open to it. DMs are open.
```

**Mixed Review (some valid, some not):**
```
Appreciate the feedback! A few thoughts:

✅ You're right about [valid point]—we're working on that.
❌ On [incorrect point], here's the context: [correction with evidence]

Always happy to discuss more. We're building this together.
```

**Unfair/Inaccurate Review:**
```
Hey, saw your [review/post]. Want to address a few things:

[Point 1]: [Factual correction with evidence]
[Point 2]: [Factual correction with evidence]

Happy to chat directly if you want to discuss further. We're not perfect but we try to be transparent.
```

### Competitor Attack Responses

**Direct Attack:**
```
[Generally: Don't engage directly. If you must:]

We focus on our work, not others. Here's what we've actually accomplished:
• [Achievement 1]
• [Achievement 2]
• [Achievement 3]

Happy to let the results speak for themselves. 🤝
```

**Indirect Comparison (someone asking "why HairDAO over X"):**
```
Different approaches for the same goal! Here's how we're different:

• [Differentiator 1]
• [Differentiator 2]
• [Differentiator 3]

Not here to bash anyone—more people working on hair loss solutions is good for everyone. Do your research and pick what resonates!
```

### When to Engage vs. Ignore

**ENGAGE when:**
| Situation | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Legitimate question from real account | Builds trust, helps others watching |
| Influencer or large account | High visibility, worth addressing |
| Factual inaccuracies spreading | Correct the record before it spreads |
| Someone who seems genuinely confused | Easy win, they might become supporters |

**IGNORE when:**
| Situation | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Obvious troll with tiny following | Don't amplify, waste of time |
| Repeat offender who won't change mind | Diminishing returns |
| Clearly bad faith actor | Engaging validates them |
| Late-night rage post | Often deletes itself, let it go |

**THE 24-HOUR RULE:**
For non-urgent criticism, wait 24 hours before responding. Often:
- The post gets no traction
- Others defend you first
- You craft a better response with cooler head

### Crisis Escalation Matrix

| Severity | Example | Response Time | Who Responds |
|----------|---------|---------------|--------------|
| Low | Random troll tweet | 24h or ignore | Community mod |
| Medium | Influencer criticism | 4-6 hours | Senior team |
| High | Viral negative thread | 1-2 hours | Core team + legal review |
| Critical | Security incident, major FUD | Immediate | All hands, coordinated response |

**Crisis Response Template (High Severity):**
```
We're aware of [situation]. Here's what we know:

[Factual summary]

What we're doing:
[Action 1]
[Action 2]

We'll provide updates as we learn more. Transparency is core to who we are.
