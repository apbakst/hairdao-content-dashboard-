## 📧 EMAIL SEQUENCE

### Email 1: Announcement (Day 0)

**Subject Line Options:**
1. We tested Precision Dutasteride. Here's what happened to DHT.
2. The DHT data is in.
3. [DATA] This changes everything we know about topical dutasteride
4. Our Precision Dutasteride results are here
5. We did the testing no one else would do

**Email Body:**

```
Subject: The DHT data is in.

Hey [FIRST_NAME],

We've been quiet for a reason.

For the past [X] months, we've been running comprehensive DHT testing on Precision Dutasteride users. Real people. Real blood draws. Real data.

Today, we're sharing the results.

**The headline:**
→ [X]% average reduction in scalp DHT
→ [X]% average reduction in serum DHT
→ [X] participants over [X] weeks

This is the data the hair loss industry has never provided. Until now.

**Why this matters:**

Most topical dutasteride products make claims without evidence. We went the opposite direction—we got the evidence first, then made the claims.

What we found: Precision Dutasteride delivers meaningful DHT suppression at the scalp while keeping systemic exposure [significantly lower than oral / within acceptable ranges].

**Full breakdown:**
We've put together a complete thread walking through:
- The testing methodology
- Individual participant results
- What this means for regrowth expectations
- What we're testing next

→ [READ THE FULL DATA THREAD]

This is just the beginning. Regrowth data is coming.

More soon,
[SIGNATURE]

P.S. — If you've been on the fence about trying Precision Dutasteride, this is the data we'd want to see before trying anything ourselves.

**Email Body:**

```
Subject: The science behind the DHT numbers

Hey [FIRST_NAME],

After we shared the DHT data, your questions came flooding in.

Today we're going deeper.

**The most common questions:**

**"How is topical different from oral?"**
Oral dutasteride floods your entire system. Every cell gets exposed. That's why side effects happen.

Precision Dutasteride uses [DELIVERY MECHANISM] to concentrate the active ingredient where it matters—your scalp—while minimizing systemic absorption.

The data shows this is working: [X]% scalp DHT reduction with only [X]% serum reduction.

**"Why hasn't anyone else done this testing?"**
Honestly? It's expensive. It's slow. And most companies don't want to know the answer.

We spent $[X] on this study because we believe transparency builds trust. If the data was bad, we'd tell you that too.

**"What about side effects?"**
In our cohort of [X] participants over [X] weeks:
- [X] reported [SIDE EFFECT DATA]
- [X]% reported no sides
- [ADDITIONAL METRICS]

This isn't FDA trial data—it's real-world evidence from real users.

**"When will you have regrowth data?"**
We're [X] months into tracking regrowth metrics. First results expected [TIMEFRAME].

Want to be first to know when regrowth data drops?

→ [JOIN THE REGROWTH UPDATES WAITLIST]

We'll email you the moment we have something to share.

[SIGNATURE]

P.S. — Hit reply if you have questions we didn't cover. We read everything.

We're not slowing down. This is what DeSci looks like in practice: open data, continuous iteration, community-driven research.

**One ask:**

If this data helped you make a decision—or if you know someone struggling with hair loss who needs to see this—forward this email.

→ [SHARE WITH A FRIEND]

The more people who see this, the more pressure on the industry to actually prove their claims work.

Thanks for being part of this.

### 3. Reply to Common Objections

**"This is just marketing"**
```
Fair skepticism.

Here's the raw data: [LINK]
Here's our methodology: [LINK]
Here's how to verify: [LINK]

We're not asking you to trust us. We're showing you the receipts.
```

**"Oral is better"**
```
Oral dutasteride: [X]% DHT suppression, systemic exposure to every cell

Precision Dutasteride: [X]% scalp DHT suppression, [X]% serum

Different tools for different goals. Some people want maximum suppression. Some want targeted delivery.

Now there's data on both.
```

**"Sample size too small"**
```
You're right—[X] participants isn't a Phase 3 trial.

But it's [X] more participants than most topical dut products have ever tested.

We're running more. This is v1 data, not the final word.
```

### 4. Meme Format

```
POV: you just found out topical dutasteride actually works and you've been suffering with oral side effects for 3 years

[IMAGE: shocked/mind-blown reaction]

### 7. "What We're NOT Claiming" (Transparency)

```
What this data DOESN'T prove:

❌ Precision Dut regrows hair (we're still testing this)
❌ It works for everyone
❌ Zero side effects
❌ Better than oral for maximum suppression

What it DOES prove:

✅ Meaningful scalp DHT reduction
✅ Lower systemic exposure than oral
✅ The mechanism works as designed

Transparency > hype.

"So we did what no one else would do. We took [X] real people, gave them Precision Dutasteride for [X] weeks, and ran actual blood tests. Scalp DHT. Serum DHT. Everything."

RESULTS (30-45 sec):
"The results? [X]% reduction in scalp DHT. [X]% reduction in serum DHT. That's meaningful suppression where it matters, with way less systemic exposure than oral."

CTA (45-60 sec):
"Full data breakdown is in our bio. This is just the beginning—regrowth data is coming. Follow for updates."

### 4. "Myths About Dutasteride"

**Format:** Text reveals / reaction video

```
MYTH 1: "Topical dut doesn't absorb"
TRUTH: Our data shows [X]% scalp DHT reduction. It absorbs.

MYTH 2: "Topical is just as systemic as oral"
TRUTH: [X]% serum reduction vs [X]% with oral. Not even close.

MYTH 3: "There's no data on topical dut"
TRUTH: There wasn't. Now there is. [X] participants. [X] weeks. Real blood tests.

MYTH 4: "It's all marketing"
TRUTH: We published the raw data. Go verify it yourself.

Caption:
Tired of myths? Us too.

That's why we spent $[X] on actual testing.

### 5. Founder Talking Head Script

```
[ANDREW TO CAMERA]

"People keep asking why we spent so much money testing our own product.

Here's the thing—I was losing my hair too. And when I looked for solutions, every product made big claims with zero evidence.

'Reduces DHT!' How much? 'Targets the scalp!' Prove it.

No one could.

So when we built Precision Dutasteride, we decided to do something different. We'd get the evidence first. Real testing. Real blood draws. Real data.

It took [X] months and cost us $[X]. 

Was it worth it? 

Look at the results: [X]% scalp DHT reduction with only [X]% systemic exposure.

This is what the hair loss industry should've been doing all along.

And we're just getting started. Regrowth data is next.

Follow along—and hold us accountable."

## 💼 LINKEDIN (Andrew Bakst)

### Professional Announcement Post

```
We just published the first comprehensive DHT data on topical dutasteride.

After [X] months of testing with [X] participants:
→ [X]% average reduction in scalp DHT
→ [X]% average reduction in serum DHT
→ Methodology, raw data, and analysis all public

Why does this matter?

The hair loss industry has operated on claims without evidence for too long. "Clinically proven" often means a single study from 1998. "Doctor recommended" means one dermatologist got paid.

At [COMPANY], we're building differently. Open data. Transparent methodology. Community verification.

This isn't just about hair loss—it's about what consumer health products should look like in 2024.

The playbook:
1. Make a product
2. Test it rigorously (even if results might be bad)
3. Publish everything
4. Let the data speak

We spent $[X] on this study. If the results were bad, we'd have published that too.

This is what DeSci (decentralized science) looks like in practice.

Full data and methodology: [LINK]

Regrowth data coming [TIMEFRAME].

### Why This Matters for DeSci

```
We just proved a model that could change consumer health.

Background: [COMPANY] makes Precision Dutasteride, a topical treatment for hair loss. Last week, we published comprehensive DHT testing data on [X] real users.

But this post isn't about hair loss. It's about what happens when you apply DeSci principles to consumer products.

Traditional model:
- Company makes claims
- Customers trust (or don't)
- No verification possible
- Incentives misaligned

What we did:
- Ran rigorous testing ($[X], [X] months)
- Published raw data openly
- Invited community verification
- Let results speak for themselves

The result? More trust. More sales. And a template other companies can follow.

DeSci isn't just for academic research. It's a framework for building consumer trust through transparency.

Imagine if every supplement company had to publish absorption data. Every skincare brand had to show actual skin penetration studies. Every health product had to prove its claims publicly.

That's the world we're building toward.

The hair loss industry was just our starting point.

What industry needs this approach next?
